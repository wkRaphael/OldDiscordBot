# OldDiscordBot
My old discord bot coded using Discord.JS v13

I'm not great at coding and this is one of the first projects I took on, I code as a hobby so it's not amazing
When Discord.JS v14 came out I decided instead of changing the code from v13 to work with v14 I would switch to Eris (https://abal.moe/Eris/) which my current bot uses
I wanted to release this code publicly for a while but I never got around to it, the old repository had sensitive information and making a new one is the best way I could find to clear that from the history
I wouldn't recommend using this code for anything, it's more for entertainment value as a lot of the code is poorly written
